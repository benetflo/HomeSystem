# SmartHomeSystem
This is my Smart Home project, where I will be able to display the temperature in two separate rooms as well as the outdoor temperature via an API call to the open-source weather API "Open-Meteo" on a touchscreen. I will also be able to control devices, such as a LED strip (on/off, change color, color scenes). I will update this document as I go, but so far, I have a working temperature solution in place.
